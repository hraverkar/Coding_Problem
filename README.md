# Coding_Problem
Problem to solve daily programming challenges. (Programing language is C#)

* top level class: internal
* method: private
* members (unless an interface or enum): private (including nested classes)
* members (of interface or enum): public
* constructor: private (note that if no constructor is explicitly defined, a public default constructor will be automatically defined)
* delegate: internal
* interface: internal
* explicitly implemented interface member: public!
