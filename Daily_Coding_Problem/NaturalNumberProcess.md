Properties of Addition of Natural Numbers:
* Sum of 1st ‘n’ Natural numbers =  1 + 2 + 3 + …. + n = n(n+1)2
* Sum of squares of 1st ‘n’ natural number  =  12 + 22 + 32 + ….. + n2  = n(n+1)(2n+1)6
* Sum of cubes of 1st ‘n’ Natural number  =  13 + 23 + 33 + ….. + n3  = (n(n+1)2)2
* Sum of 1st ‘n’ Odd natural number  =  1+ 3 + 5 + ….. + (2n – 1)  = n2
* Sum of 1st ‘n’ even natural numbers  = 2 + 4 + 6+ …….2n = n (n+1)
* Sum of squares of 1st ‘n’ Odd natural number = 12 + 32 + 52 + ….. + (2n – 1) 2 = n(2n−1)(2n+1)3
* Sum of squares of 1st ‘n’ Even natural number =  22 + 42 + 62 + ….. + (2n)2 = 2n(n+1)(2n+1)3
* Sum of cubes of 1st  ‘n’ Odd natural number =  13 + 33 + 53 + ….. + (2n -1)3 = n2 (2n2 -1)
* Sum of cubes of 1st  ‘n’ Even natural number  =  23 + 43 + 63 + ….. + (2n)3 = 2 [n (n + 1)]2
